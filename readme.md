# Mongrate: MongoDB Migrations

Mongrate provides database / data-structure migrations for MongoDB, with NodeJS and MongooseJS 
models / schemas.

Changing your document structure in MongoDB is no different than changing a table structure
in a relational database, when it comes to migrating data. The migration needs to be done - 
you need your new data structure to be populated with the data from the old structure.

Mongrate will help you get there by providing a structure and framework in which you can
migrate from your old MongoDB collections and document structures, in to your new one.

## Getting Started

Start by installing mongrate in your project:

```
npm install --save mongrate
```
